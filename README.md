Measure it!
===========

Measure it! is an iPhone app that allows users to estimate the size of objects in an photo.

It was featured in Apple's TV campaigns in 2010 (see link above).  

Hasn't been worked on since 2009 so will need updating in terms of modern Obj-C / ARC / Twitter integrations.

Was an interesting idea but had some flaws in execution.
